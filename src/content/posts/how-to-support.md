## Four Main Requisites

Monks aren't allowed to **use money**, so they depend on having their basic requisites **offered directly**.

Monks have four main requisites:

1. **Food**
2. **Robes**
3. **Shelter**
4. **Medicine**  
   Additionally, other **miscellaneous necessities** may arise.

## Offering Food

Monks **can't store food, cook for themselves, or eat after midday**. Offerings should be made in the **morning** before **midday**:

- **Midday during daylight savings time (Mar-Nov):** ~**1PM**
- **Midday after daylight savings ends (Nov-Mar):** ~**12PM**

There are two ways to offer food:

1. **Alms Round:**  
   If Bhante doesn't have a specific invitation, he will go on **alms round**, walking around town until he has enough food or it gets close to midday.

   - Alms round typically runs from **7:30-8AM** to **10:30-11AM** (variable).

2. **Formal Meal Offering:**
   - Arrange in advance (the day before or earlier).
   - Ideally, plan to serve food by **10:30AM** (non-daylight savings) or **11:30AM** (daylight savings).
   - Can be offered **at his residence or within 4 miles**.

## Offering Robes

- The best way is to express interest, and Bhante will let you know when robes are needed.
- Robes are usually offered during the **robes season** (the last month of the rainy season).
- **In California, robes season is from the full moon in February to the full moon in March.**

## Offering Shelter

- Shelter offerings can range from **land, a separate unit, a garage, or a private room**.
- Monks **cannot share a room** with a **non-ordained person for more than three nights**, and **never with a woman**.
- Shelter should either:
  - Be **close enough for alms round**, or
  - Include **meal offerings** if it's too far.
- During the **rains retreat (Nov-Mar)**, Bhante stays in **one location for 3 months**.

## Offering Medicine

- Since medical needs arise unexpectedly, the best way is to make a **general offer**.
- If offering specific treatments (**herbs, acupuncture, etc.**), it helps to specify.
- **For expenses over several hundred dollars**, Bhante may reach out to see if others want to help share the cost.

## Other Offerings

- Common offerings: **books, nail clippers, rides, transportation costs, etc.**
- You can **make a general offer**, and Bhante can accept it within **four months**, unless you specify a longer or shorter timeframe.
