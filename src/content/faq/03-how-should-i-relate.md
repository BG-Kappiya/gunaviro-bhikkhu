title: "How Should I Relate to Bhante?"
---

Bhante is a fully committed monastic, dedicated to the path of ultimate freedom. He is happy to share his learnings with anyone who approaches with a sincere and inquiring mind.

- **Friendliness, warmth, and generosity** are always appreciated.
- **Respectful engagement** is encouraged, keeping in mind Bhante’s role as a monastic.
- While Bhante is very approachable, it’s best to avoid being overly **casual, informal, or overly familiar in a way that may not align with monastic traditions.**

If you're unsure, a good approach is to engage with kindness and mindfulness, observing how others interact in similar settings. Alternatively, you can ask Bhante himself or other lay supporters for guidance.
