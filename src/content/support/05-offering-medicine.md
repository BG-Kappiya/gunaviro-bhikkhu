title: "Offering Medicine"

- Since medical needs arise unexpectedly, the best way is to make a **general offer**.
- If offering specific treatments (**herbs, acupuncture, etc.**), it helps to specify.
- **For expenses over several hundred dollars**, Bhante may reach out to see if others want to help share the cost.
