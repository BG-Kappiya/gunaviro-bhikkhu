title: "The Four Main Requisites"
---

Monks aren't allowed to **use money**, so they depend on having their basic requisites **offered directly**.

Monks have four main requisites:

1. **Food**
2. **Robes**
3. **Shelter**
4. **Medicine**

Additionally, other **miscellaneous necessities** may arise.
