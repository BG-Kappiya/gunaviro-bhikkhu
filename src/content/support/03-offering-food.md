title: "Offering Food to Bhante"
---

Monks **can't store food, cook for themselves, or eat after midday**. Offerings should be made in the **morning** before **midday**:

- **Midday during daylight savings time (Mar-Nov):** ~**1PM**
- **Midday after daylight savings ends (Nov-Mar):** ~**12PM**

There are two ways to offer food:

**1. Alms Round:**  
 If Bhante doesn't have a specific invitation, he will go on **alms round**, walking around town until he has enough food or it gets close to midday.

- Alms round typically runs from **7:30-8AM** to **10:30-11AM** (variable).

**2. Formal Meal Offering:**

- Arrange in advance (the day before or earlier).
- Ideally, plan to serve food by **10:30AM** (non-daylight savings) or **11:30AM** (daylight savings).
- Can be offered **at his residence or within 4 miles**.
