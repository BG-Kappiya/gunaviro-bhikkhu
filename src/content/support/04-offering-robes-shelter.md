title: "Offering Robes and Shelter"
---

## Offering Robes

- The best way is to express interest, and Bhante will let you know when robes are needed.
- Robes are usually offered during the **robes season** (the last month of the rainy season).
- **In California, robes season is from the full moon in February to the full moon in March.**

## Offering Shelter

- Shelter offerings can range from **land, a separate unit, a garage, or a private room**.
- Monks **cannot share a room** with a **non-ordained person for more than three nights**, and **never with a woman**.
- Shelter should either:
  - Be **close enough for alms round**, or
  - Include **meal offerings** if it's too far.
- During the **rains retreat (Nov-Mar)**, Bhante stays in **one location for 3 months**.
